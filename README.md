# Homun Language Reference

> A lightweight scripting language designed for ECS game engine client-side logic, in Rust.
> Compiles / transpiles directly to Rust. Designed to be embeddable, minimal, and expressive.

---

## Overview

Homun is a statically-typed, expression-oriented scripting language that targets the Rust compiler
as its backend. It is designed to run on the **client side** of a Rust-based ECS game engine,
providing a safe, readable, and concise scripting surface without requiring game developers to write
raw Rust. Every valid Homun program maps 1-to-1 to valid Rust code, which means you get Rust's
performance and safety guarantees at runtime, while writing code that feels closer to Python or Go
in day-to-day use.

The philosophy of Homun is radical simplicity:

- No classes, no interfaces, no inheritance — only structs and enums.
- No functions as a distinct construct — everything callable is a lambda.
- No imports — the engine exposes its API through the environment.
- No semicolons — newlines are enough.
- No mutable/immutable split in the declaration syntax — assignments are clear and uniform.
- No `=` operator at all — `:=` binds, `==` compares. There is no ambiguity between assignment and equality.
- All collections share the `@` prefix — lists `@[]`, dicts `@{}`, sets `@()` — visually consistent and parser-friendly.
- Strict naming conventions: variables and lambdas are `snake_case`, structs and enums are recommended as `PascalCase`.
- 1-based indexing throughout, matching the intuition of designers and artists who may not be programmers.
- Native RON (Rusty Object Notation) integration — data structs round-trip to/from RON automatically.

## Design Goals

| Goal | Decision |
|---|---|
| Familiar to Python/Go developers | `:=` assignment, Python keywords like `and`, `or`, `in`, `not` |
| No ceremony around functions | All callables are lambdas `\|\|{...}` |
| Safe mapping to Rust | No raw pointers, no unsafe constructs |
| Readable game logic | `if () do {}`, `elif`, `match` with `_` wildcard |
| Minimal syntax noise | No `;`, no `mut`, no `import`, no bare `=` |
| Unambiguous equality | Only `==` for comparison — `:=` is the sole assignment form |
| Consistent collection syntax | All collections prefixed with `@`: `@[]` `@{}` `@()` |
| Clear naming at a glance | Variables/lambdas `snake_case`, types `PascalCase` (recommended) |
| Designer-friendly indexing | 1-based, inclusive slicing |
| Game data pipeline | Native RON support — data structs are format and code simultaneously |
| Transparent recursion | Compiler auto-detects recursive lambdas via two-stage parse — no `rec` keyword needed |

---

## Comments

Single-line comments use `//`. Multi-line comments use `/* */`.

```
// this is a single-line comment

/* this is a
   multi-line comment */

x := 10  // inline comment
```

---

## Variable Assignment

Homun uses `:=` for all variable bindings, inspired by Go. There is no `var`, `let`, or `const`
keyword. There is also no `mut` keyword — mutability rules are handled at the Rust transpilation
layer, keeping the scripting surface clean.

```
x      := 10
name   := "hero"
speed  := float(3.14)
active := true
```

Types are inferred automatically from the right-hand side, similar to `auto` in C++. You may also
be explicit by wrapping the value in a type constructor:

```
hp    := int(100)
ratio := float(0.5)
label := str("player_one")
```

Rebinding an existing name simply updates the binding. There is no distinction between declaration
and reassignment in the syntax — the compiler resolves this contextually.

---

## Naming Conventions

Homun enforces and recommends strict naming conventions to keep code readable across a team of
engineers and non-engineers alike.

### Variables and Lambdas — enforced `snake_case`

All variable names and lambda names **must** be `lower_case` or `snake_case`. Uppercase letters
are **not permitted** in variable names. The compiler will reject names like `mySpeed`, `PlayerHP`,
or `X`. This is a hard rule, not a style suggestion.

```
// VALID
player_hp          := 100
move_speed         := 3.5
on_death           := || -> () { respawn() }
base_attack_damage := 25

// INVALID — compiler error
playerHp  := 100    // camelCase not allowed
MoveSpeed := 3.5    // uppercase start not allowed
X         := 10     // single uppercase letter not allowed
```

### Structs and Enums — recommended `PascalCase`

Type definitions (structs and enums) are recommended to use `PascalCase`. This is not enforced by
the compiler but is the strong convention for all Homun code. It makes it immediately obvious when
a name refers to a type versus a value, without requiring a type-inference pass.

```
// Recommended: PascalCase for types
PlayerState := struct { hp: int, alive: bool }
Direction   := enum { North, South, East, West }
WeaponKind  := enum { Sword(int), Bow(int), Staff }

// Allowed but strongly discouraged
player_state := struct { hp: int }
```

This asymmetry is intentional: types exist at compile time, values exist at runtime. Keeping their
naming visually distinct helps tools, LLMs, and human readers alike.

---

## Operators and Equality

Homun has **no bare `=` operator**. This eliminates an entire class of bugs common in C-family
languages where `=` and `==` are accidentally swapped.

| Operator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `:=` | Bind a name to a value (declaration or rebinding) |
| `==` | Equality comparison, returns `bool` |
| `!=` | Inequality comparison, returns `bool` |
| `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` | Numeric comparison |
| `and`, `or`, `not` | Boolean logic (Python-style keywords) |
| `in`, `not in` | Membership test for lists, sets, dict keys |
| `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` | Arithmetic |

Using a bare `=` is a syntax error. If you see `:=` it is always a binding. If you see `==` it is
always a comparison. No ambiguity exists anywhere in the language.

```
x := 10
y := x == 10      // y is true
z := x != 5       // z is true

if (x == 10) do { print("ten") }
```

### Membership Tests

```
s := @("fire", "ice", "poison")

if x in s do { apply(x) }
if not x in s do { skip() }
```

Works on lists, sets, and dict keys.

## Primitive Types

| Type | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `int` | `42`, `int(42)` | 64-bit signed integer |
| `float` | `3.14`, `float(3.14)` | 64-bit float |
| `bool` | `true`, `false` | |
| `str` | `"hello"` | UTF-8, supports `${}` interpolation |
| `none` | `none` | Missing value — equivalent to Rust's None |

`none` is a single unified keyword serving two roles. As a **return type annotation** on a lambda,
it means the lambda returns nothing (void). As a **value**, it means absence — the equivalent of
Rust's `None`. There is no separate `null`, `nil`, or `Option` keyword. Use `match` to safely
handle `none` values.

---

## String Interpolation

Strings support inline variable interpolation using `${}` syntax:

```
name  := "Aria"
level := 5

greeting := "Hello, ${name}! You are level ${level}."
log      := "Dealt ${base * multiplier * 2} damage after crit."
```

Any expression is valid inside `${}`.

---

## Lambdas (All Callables)

There are no named functions in Homun. Every callable value is a lambda. Lambdas are first-class
values that can be assigned to names, passed as arguments, or returned from other lambdas.

### Basic Lambda

```
greet := |name| { "Hello ${name}" }
```

The last expression in the body is implicitly returned. No `return` keyword is needed.

### Lambda with No Arguments

```
tick := || { update_physics() }
```

### Return Type Hints

Annotate the return type with `->` after the parameter list:

```
add       := |a, b| -> int  { a + b }
log_event := |msg|  -> () { print(msg) }
```

`-> ()` is the only way to express a void return. 

### Recursive Lambdas

Homun uses a **two-stage compiler**. In stage one, the compiler scans all lambda bodies for
self-references before full parsing. Any lambda whose body contains its own name is automatically
treated as recursive — no `rec` keyword or special syntax is needed by the author.

```
// this just works — compiler detects self-reference automatically
fib := |n| {
  if (n <= 1) do { n } else { fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) }
}
```

Mutual recursion also works at the top level, because stage one registers all top-level names
before any body is resolved:

```
is_even := |n| { if (n == 0) do { true }  else { is_odd(n-1) } }
is_odd  := |n| { if (n == 0) do { false } else { is_even(n-1) } }
```

The compiler emits a Rust `fn` for recursive lambdas and a Rust closure for non-recursive ones.
This distinction is completely invisible to the Homun author.

### Lambdas as Values

```
transform := |x| { x * 2 }
doubled   := @[1, 2, 3, 4].map(transform)
```

---

## Pipe Operator `.`

The `.` operator is the pipe/method-call syntax. It desugars to passing the left-hand side as the
first argument to the right-hand side:

```
x.map(f)        // desugars to: map(x, f)
x.filter(pred)  // desugars to: filter(x, pred)
x.reduce(f)     // desugars to: reduce(x, f)
```

Chains read naturally as a pipeline:

```
result := @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  .filter(|x| { x > 2 })
  .map(|x| { x * 10 })
  .reduce(|a, b| { a + b })
```

Field access also uses `.` — context determines whether it is a pipe call or a field read:

```
p.hp      // field access — p.hp is a value
p.map(f)  // pipe call   — desugars to map(p, f)
```

---

## Collections

All collection literals are prefixed with `@`. The bracket shape that follows tells you the kind.
A bare `(...)` without `@` is always a grouping expression, never a collection.

| Syntax | Kind | Ordered | Duplicates | Rust type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `@[...]` | List | yes | yes | `Vec<T>` |
| `@{...}` | Dict | no | keys unique | `HashMap<K,V>` |
| `@(...)` | Set | no | no | `HashSet<T>` |

### Lists (Dynamic Arrays)

```
empty := @[]
items := @[1, 2, 3]
names := @["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
```

List comprehension:

```
squares := @[x * x for x in upto(10)]
evens   := @[x for x in upto(20) if x % 2 == 0]
```

### Dicts (Hash Maps)

```
empty_map := @{}
scores    := @{"alice": 100, "bob": 80}
```

Dict comprehension:

```
inverted := @{v: k for k, v in scores}
squared  := @{x: x*x for x in upto(5)}
```

Dict access and update:

```
s := scores["alice"]    // returns the value, or none if key missing
scores["alice"] := 90   // update or insert
```

If a key does not exist, dict access returns `none`. Guard with `match` when the key may be absent:

```
match scores["unknown"] {
  none => print("not found")
  val  => print("score: ${val}")
}
```

### Sets

Sets are unordered and contain no duplicate values.

```
visited   := @(1, 3, 5, 7)
flags     := @("fire", "ice", "poison")
empty_set := @()
```

Set comprehension:

```
unique_floors := @(x for x in floor_list)
```

---

## Slicing and Indexing

Homun is **1-based**. The first element of any list is at index `1`. All slicing is inclusive on
both ends.

### Single Index

```
first := items[1]
third := items[3]
```

### Slicing `[start..end]` and `[start..end, step]`

```
x := @[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

x[1..3]      // [10, 20, 30]      — elements 1, 2, 3
x[3..1, -1]  // [30, 20, 10]      — elements 3, 2, 1 (reversed)
x[2..5]      // [20, 30, 40, 50]  — elements 2, 3, 4, 5
x[1..5, 2]   // [10, 30, 50]      — every other element
```

Because slices are inclusive and 1-based, `[3..1, -1]` yields exactly three elements: the 3rd,
2nd, and 1st — in that order. This differs from Python where `[3:1:-1]` is 0-based and
exclusive-end.

### Numeric Ranges

`upto(n)` generates a 1-based range from 1 to n inclusive. For ranges that do not start at 1,
use `from(a, b)` which is also inclusive on both ends:

```
upto(5)     // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
from(3, 7)  // 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```

Both are usable in `for` loops and comprehensions:

```
for i in from(5, 10) do { print(i) }
mid := @[x for x in from(3, 7)]
```

---

## Control Flow

### The `do` Rule

Any block preceded by a condition expression uses `do` before the opening `{`. This applies
uniformly to `if`, `elif`, `for`, and `while`. A bare `else` has no condition and therefore
no `do`.

### `if` / `elif` / `else`

```
if (hp <= 0) do {
  die()
} elif (hp < 20) do {
  play_low_health_sound()
} else {
  recover()
}
```

One-liner form:

```
if (x > 10) do { print("big") } else { print("small") }
```

Boolean operators use Python-style keywords:

```
if (alive and not frozen) do { move() }
if (on_fire or in_water) do { apply_effect() }
if not x in visited do { explore(x) }
```

### `match`

`match` is an expression — its result can be directly assigned. Use `_` as the wildcard/default
arm. The compiler warns if a `match` is non-exhaustive and no `_` arm exists.

```
result := match dir {
  Direction.North => move(0, 1)
  Direction.South => move(0, -1)
  Direction.East  => move(1, 0)
  Direction.West  => move(-1, 0)
}
```

Matching enum variants that carry data:

```
dmg := match element {
  Element.Fire(power) => power * 2
  Element.Ice(power)  => power * 1.5
  _                   => 0
}
```

Matching `none` for missing values:

```
match find_target(pos) {
  none   => idle()
  target => attack(target)
}
```

---

## Loops

### `for` over a range

```
for i in upto(10) do {
  print("Step ${i}")
}
```

### `for` over a list

```
for item in inventory do {
  use(item)
}
```

### `while`

```
while (enemies_remaining > 0) do {
  attack_nearest()
}
```

### `break` and `continue`

`break` exits the nearest enclosing loop. `continue` skips to the next iteration. Both work
transparently inside `match` blocks — `match` is not a loop and does not intercept them.

```
for entity in entities do {
  if (entity.hp == 0) do { continue }
  if (entity.is_boss)  do { break }
  attack(entity)
}
```

Using `break` and `continue` inside a `match` inside a loop:

```
for item in inventory do {
  match item.kind {
    ItemKind.Key  => break     // exits the for loop
    ItemKind.Junk => continue  // skips to next item
    _             => use(item)
  }
}
```

---

## Destructuring and Swap

Multiple names can be bound simultaneously on the left side of `:=`. The right-hand side is fully
evaluated before any binding occurs, making swaps always safe. Use `_` to discard a value.

```
a, b := b, a              // swap a and b
_, second := get_pair()   // discard first, keep second
x, y := y, x + y          // Fibonacci step
```

---

## Result and `none`

Homun uses `none` as a unified concept for both void returns and missing values. For operations
that can fail with a reason, Homun uses Rust's `Result<T, E>` model with `Ok` and `Err`:

```
r := load_file("map.ron")

match r {
  Ok(data) => process(data)
  Err(msg) => print("failed: ${msg}")
}
```

Constructing results in a lambda:

```
safe_div := |a, b| -> Result {
  if (b == 0) do { Err("division by zero") } else { Ok(a / b) }
}
```

For simple nullable values — presence or absence with no error message — use `none` directly and
match on it:

```
target := find_nearest_enemy(pos)   // returns a value or none

match target {
  none => idle()
  t    => attack(t)
}
```

---

## Structs

Homun has no classes. Data is organized with structs. Behavior is modeled by assigning lambdas
that accept structs as parameters.

### Named Structs

```
Player := struct {
  name:  str
  hp:    int
  speed: float
}

create_player := |n, h, s| -> Player {
  Player { name: n, hp: h, speed: s }
}

p := create_player("Aria", 100, 3.5)
print(p.name)
```

### Anonymous Structs

A struct literal without a named type is valid. The compiler generates a synthetic Rust struct
behind the scenes. Field access by name works normally. Two anonymous structs with identical field
names and types are treated as the same type.

```
pos := { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 }
print(pos.x)
```

### Field Mutation

Fields are updated using `:=` with dot access:

```
p.hp    := p.hp - 10
p.speed := 5.0
```

This desugars to a Rust `let mut` rebinding of the struct. Structs are value types — mutations are
local unless the struct is explicitly returned or passed back out.

### Data Structs vs Behavior Structs

The compiler automatically classifies every struct into one of two kinds based on its fields:

**Data structs** — all fields are primitives, other data structs, lists, dicts, or sets. No lambda
fields. These are automatically RON-serializable and get `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]`
in the transpiled Rust.

```
// data struct — RON compatible, auto-derives Serialize + Deserialize
Vec2   := struct { x: float, y: float }
Player := struct { name: str, hp: int, pos: Vec2 }
```

**Behavior structs** — at least one field is a lambda type. Not RON-serializable. Get only
`#[derive(Clone)]`.

```
// behavior struct — NOT RON compatible
EnemyAI := struct {
  state:   str
  on_tick: || -> ()    // lambda field disqualifies RON
}
```

The author never declares which kind a struct is. The compiler infers it entirely from field types.

---

## Enums and Match

Enums define a closed set of named variants, optionally carrying data.

```
Direction := enum { North, South, East, West }

Element := enum {
  Fire(int)
  Ice(int)
  Neutral
}

WeaponKind := enum {
  Sword(int)
  Bow(int)
  Staff
}
```

Pattern matching with wildcard:

```
result := match dir {
  Direction.North => move(0, 1)
  Direction.South => move(0, -1)
  Direction.East  => move(1, 0)
  Direction.West  => move(-1, 0)
}

dmg := match element {
  Element.Fire(p) => p * 2
  Element.Ice(p)  => p * 1.5
  _               => 0        // wildcard arm
}
```

`match` is exhaustive — the compiler warns if not all variants are covered and no `_` arm exists.

---

## RON Integration

Homun has native support for **RON (Rusty Object Notation)**, the structured data format used
throughout the Rust game engine ecosystem. Because Homun struct literals and RON share the same
conceptual model, data structs in Homun are simultaneously code and serialized data format.

### Loading RON Files

```
map := load_ron("levels/world1.ron") as Map
print("width: ${map.width}")
```

The `as Type` annotation is required. The compiler validates the RON file against the named struct
at **compile time** — missing fields, wrong types, and unknown keys are compile errors, not runtime
crashes. Level designers editing RON files get full type checking for free.

### Saving RON Files

Any data struct can be written to RON with no extra configuration:

```
config := ServerConfig { host: "localhost", port: 8080 }
save_ron(config, "config.ron")
```

### Homun Struct Literals and RON Share the Same Grammar

A pure-data Homun struct literal is valid RON and can round-trip through it without loss. The only
syntactic difference is that Homun list literals use `@[...]` while RON uses `[...]` — the compiler
strips the `@` prefix when emitting RON automatically.

```
// this Homun value...
template := Enemy {
  name: "Goblin",
  hp:   30,
  loot: @["gold_coin", "rusty_sword"],
}

// ...round-trips to/from this RON exactly:
// Enemy(
//   name: "Goblin",
//   hp: 30,
//   loot: ["gold_coin", "rusty_sword"],
// )
```

### RON Collection Mapping

| Homun | RON |
|---|---|
| `@[...]` list | `[...]` array |
| `@{...}` dict | `{...}` map |
| `@(...)` set | `[...]` array (deduplication applied on load) |
| Struct literal | `TypeName(field: value, ...)` |

### Restrictions

Only **data structs** are RON-compatible. Calling `save_ron` on a behavior struct (one with lambda
fields) is a **compile error**. The entire game data pipeline — levels, configs, templates, save
files — can be built on data structs and RON with zero boilerplate.

---

---

## Rust Transpilation Notes

Homun compiles to idiomatic Rust. The naming conventions of Homun (`snake_case` for values,
`PascalCase` for types) match Rust's own conventions exactly, so no name mangling is ever needed.

| Homun | Rust |
|---|---|
| `:=` binding | `let` (or `let mut` when compiler detects reassignment) |
| `==` equality | `==` (no bare `=` exists in Homun) |
| Non-recursive lambda | Rust closure `\|...\| { ... }` |
| Recursive lambda | Rust named `fn` (auto-detected, two-stage compile) |
| `@[...]` list | `Vec<T>` |
| `@{...}` dict | `HashMap<K, V>` |
| `@(...)` set | `HashSet<T>` |
| Data struct | `struct` with `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone)]` |
| Behavior struct | `struct` with `#[derive(Clone)]` |
| Enum | `enum` |
| `match` with `_` | `match` with `_` wildcard arm |
| `.` pipe | function call with receiver as first argument |
| String `${}` | `format!()` macro |
| `and`, `or`, `not` | `&&`, `\|\|`, `!` |
| `in`, `not in` | `.contains()` |
| `-> ()` return | `()` unit type |
| `none` value | `Option::None` |
| `Ok(v)`, `Err(e)` | `Result::Ok(v)`, `Result::Err(e)` |
| `p.field := v` | `let mut p = p; p.field = v;` |
| `a, b := b, a` | `let (a, b) = (b, a);` |
| `load_ron(p) as T` | `ron::from_str::<T>(...)` with compile-time schema validation |
| 1-based slice `[i..j]` | index arithmetic with bounds check |
| Variable `snake_case` | Rust `snake_case` — no mangling |
| Type `PascalCase` | Rust `PascalCase` — no mangling |
